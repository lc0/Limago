Limago - learn language easily
===================================

Learning a language can be difficult, especially if the words are not in a specific context. Companies like Rosetta Stone have identified this problem and use images to augment the learning experience.

We take this idea one step further:

By using LIMAGO you can learn your vocabulary by simply taking photos. For example: If you are at Oktoberfest and would like to know the german word for beer or sausage, all you need to do is take a picture of it. You will not only be shown the translation of beer, but also other interesting, context-related words.

This was made possible through the CLARIFAI API, which enables us to get reliable tags from the pictures we take, in different languages.
